## Update (July 2022)

When I started coding this project, I was strongly feeling that webpack isn't a
suffient tool for building a modern, production-ready frontend applications.

With Darty, I tried to make frontend development easy and more straight-forward
with single declarative manifest file. Even though I used webpack under the
hood, Darty was an opinionated frontend development environment and so many
complicated configurations are hidden from codebase.

Today I cannot maintain this project anymore as a single contributor. It needs
to be rewritten to compete with its current alternatives but it's impossible for
me at the moment. However abandoning projects are sad, I'm glad to see my idea
is somehow proved with the releases of Snowpack and Vite.

Please check out Vite for a community-supported, well-maintained webpack
alternative.

## README

Darty is a front-end development system to allow developers to start their
projects immediately. By Darty's convention over configuration mindset, webpack
and typescript compiler configurations are handled by darty's itself.

Darty React App is a front-end development template for
[Darty](https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty).

- Module bundling for packing everything into modules with their sourcemaps.
- Dynamic code splitting.
- SASS/LESS compilation of .scss, .sass and .less files.
- CSS Modules.
- Minification for stylesheets and scripts.
- Hot module reloading and continuous development environment.
- Isomorphic/Universal codebase between server and client.
- Server-side rendering.
- IntelliSense support on TypeScript.
- Unit-testing setup and TDD-ready environment.
- JavaScript and TypeScript linting.
- Autoprefixed CSS to avoid adding vendor prefixes.
- Containerization-ready for continuous integration/deployment environments.

## Architecture and Libraries

- React with Hooks for rendering UI components, with DevTools support.
- React Router for SPA routing.
- Semantic UI and Font-Awesome are included.
- Jest and React Testing Library for tests.
- Webpack module bundling.
- express for server-side rendering.

## Quick start

Ensure that `node.js` is installed on your system first.

### Alternative 1

- Use the GitHub template on
  [https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty-react-app/generate](https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty-react-app/generate).
- Clone your generated repository afterwards.
- Finally, use the following commands:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### Alternative 2

Use the following command to create app with
[create-darty-app](https://github.com/eserozvataf/create-darty-app):

```sh
yarn create darty-app react app
cd app
yarn dev
```

### Alternative 3

Clone the git repo and execute install dependencies from npm to get ready:

```sh
git clone --branch=master https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty-react-app.git app
cd app
yarn install
yarn dev
```
