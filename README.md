# ðŸŽ¯ [Darty React App](https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty-react-app)

Darty is a front-end development system to allow developers to start their projects immediately. By Darty's convention over configuration mindset, webpack and typescript compiler configurations are handled by darty's itself.

Darty React App is a front-end development template for [Darty](https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty).

* Dynamic code splitting.
* SASS/LESS compilation of .scss, .sass and .less files.
* CSS Modules.
* Minification for stylesheets and scripts.
* Hot module reloading and continuous development environment.
* Isomorphic/Universal codebase between server and client.
* Server-side rendering.
* IntelliSense support on TypeScript.
* Unit-testing setup and TDD-ready environment.
* JavaScript and TypeScript linting.
* Autoprefixed CSS to avoid adding vendor prefixes.
* Containerization-ready for continuous integration/deployment environments.


## Architecture and Libraries

* React with Hooks for rendering UI components, with DevTools support.
* React Router for SPA routing.
* Semantic UI and Font-Awesome are included.
* Jest and Enzyme for tests, ESLint for linting.
* Webpack module bundling.
* express for server-side rendering.


## Quick start

Ensure that `node.js` is installed on your system first.

### Alternative 1
Use the following command to create app with [create-darty-app](https://github.com/eserozvataf/create-darty-app):

```sh
yarn create darty-app react app
cd app
yarn dev
```

### Alternative 2
Clone the git repo and execute install dependencies from npm to get ready:

```sh
git clone --branch=master https://github.com/eserozvataf/darty-react-app.git app
cd app
yarn install
yarn dev
```
