The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\tfunction Promise(resolver) {\n\t  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t  this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t  if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tPromise.all = all;\n\tPromise.race = race;\n\tPromise.resolve = resolve;\n\tPromise.reject = reject;\n\tPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n\tPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\n\tPromise._asap = asap;\n\t\n\tPromise.prototype = {\n\t  constructor: Promise,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function(user){\n\t      // user is available\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Chaining\n\t    --------\n\t  \n\t    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return user.name;\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      return 'default name';\n\t    }).then(function (userName) {\n\t      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t      // will be `'default name'`\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Assimilation\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t    until the returned promise is settled.

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n  this._subscribers = [];\n\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = Resolve;\nPromise.reject = Reject;\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\nPromise._asap = asap;\n\nPromise.prototype = {\n  constructor: Promise,\n\n  /**\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function(user){\n      // user is available\n    }, function(reason){\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Chaining\n    --------\n  \n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return user.name;\n    }, function (reason) {\n      return 'default name';\n    }).then(function (userName) {\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n      // will be `'default name'`\n    });\n  \n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n    }, function (reason) {\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n    });\n    ```\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Assimilation\n    ------------\n  \n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // The user's comments are now available\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Simple Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let result;\n  \n    try {\n      result = findResult();\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n    findResult(function(result, err){\n      if (err) {\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findResult().then(function(result){\n      // success\n    },
